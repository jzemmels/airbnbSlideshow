An interactive slideshow for Airbnb listings

Do you enjoy looking up Airbnb listings simply for the fun of it?
So do I.
I created this web application using the `shiny` R package to show a slideshow of Airbnb listings from a country of interest.
I scrape image data from Airbnb using the `RSelenium` R package and create a slideshow of the images using the `slickR` package.
Click on the name of a property that you're interested in to see its Airbnb listing.
Note that this app can currently only be run on your local machine, so clone this repo to get started.
